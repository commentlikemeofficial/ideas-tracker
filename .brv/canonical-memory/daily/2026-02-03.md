## Frameworks Stored for Future Product Building

### Forward Deployed Engineer Model (Liam Ottley)
**Source:** https://youtu.be/HiC1J8a9V1I

**Core Concept:**
Instead of being a "vendor" who delivers projects and leaves, become an embedded problem-solver inside the client's business.

**Key Elements:**
1. **Embedded Positioning** - Work inside their Slack, meetings, workflows
2. **Problem-First Approach** - Find pain points in real-time, not from spec sheets
3. **Build Live** - Show solutions working within hours, not weeks
4. **Productize** - Turn custom solutions into repeatable tools

**Revenue Model:**
- $5K-$15K/month retainers
- 6-12 month engagements
- Become "their AI guy" - hard to replace

**Scaling Without Hiring:**
- One FDE handles 3-4 clients max
- Build internal tools for 10x team efficiency
- Use deployment learnings to create productized services

**Origin:** Palantir's scaling playbook

**Application Ideas:**
- AI automation agency with embedded model
- Steve as FDE for clients (research, monitoring, building)
- Productized AI services from real client pain points
