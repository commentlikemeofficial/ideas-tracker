[Discussion] Just read Menlo Ventures' 2025 State of Generative AI in the Enterprise report—here are the numbers that surprised me most **The Scale:** • $37 billion spent on generative AI in 2025 (up 3.2x from $11.5B in 2024) • AI now represents 6% of the entire global SaaS market • All this growth happened within 3 years of ChatGPT's launch **The Adoption Pattern Shift:** 76% of AI solutions are now purchased rather than built internally (was only 53% in 2024). Enterprises tried the DIY route and realized ready-made solutions reach production faster with less headache. **The Conversion Surprise:** AI buyers convert at 47% vs 25% for traditional SaaS deals. Nearly double the conversion rate. The value proposition is immediate and obvious—not speculative roadmaps. **The Startup vs Incumbent Battle:** Startups now capture 63% of AI application revenue (up from 36% last year). Despite incumbents having every structural advantage—distribution, data moats, massive balance sheets—AI-native startups are winning on product velocity. **The Killer Use Case:** Coding is the breakout category: $4B in spend (55% of all departmental AI). 50% of developers now use AI coding tools daily. Companies like Cursor are beating GitHub Copilot by being model-agnostic and shipping faster. **The LLM Market Shake-up:** Anthropic now leads enterprise LLM market with 40% share. OpenAI fell to 27% (from 50% in 2023). 18 months of coding dominance with Claude Sonnet built durable enterprise trust. **Questions for the community:** - Are you seeing this shift toward buying vs building at your company? - Which AI tools have you actually adopted vs just piloted? - Do you think startup momentum in AI apps is sustainable, or will incumbents catch up? - What's your prediction for LLM market share by end of 2025?
