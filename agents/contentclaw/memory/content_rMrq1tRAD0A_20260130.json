Some numbers that made me pause: → Enterprises spent $37B on generative AI in 2025 (up 3.2x from $11.5B in 2024) → AI is now 6% of the entire global SaaS market... after just 3 years → 76% of AI solutions are purchased, not built internally (was 53% last year) What's striking: AI buyers convert at 47% vs 25% for traditional SaaS. Nearly 2x higher. Why? Because the value is immediate and obvious. Not speculative. Not 'maybe in 18 months.' Right now productivity gains. The biggest surprise: Startups now capture 63% of the AI application market. Incumbents had every advantage—distribution, data moats, balance sheets—and they're still losing ground. In coding alone (a $4B category now), startups like Cursor are eating GitHub Copilot's lunch by shipping faster, being model-agnostic, and winning developer love. My take: We're past the experimentation phase. Enterprises aren't asking 'should we use AI?' anymore. They're asking 'which AI tools should we buy?' If you're building AI-native products, the window is wide open. But product velocity matters more than ever. What's your observation on AI adoption in your industry? #AI #SaaS #EnterpriseAI #StartupLife #BuildingInPublic #VentureCapital Source: Menlo Ventures 2025 State of Generative AI in the Enterprise Report",
  "x_thread": "🧵 The $37B AI wave is here—and the data reveals where the market is actually heading: 1/ Just read Menlo Ventures' 2025 Enterprise AI Report. Key numbers that stopped me cold: • $37B spent on generative AI in 2025 (3.2x growth from 2024) • AI now = 6% of entire global SaaS market • All this happened in just 3 years post-ChatGPT 2/ The most striking stat: AI buyers convert at 47% vs 25% for traditional SaaS. Nearly 2x higher conversion. Why? Value is immediate. Not speculative. Not 'maybe next quarter.' Right now productivity gains. 3/ Another surprise: 76% of AI solutions are PURCHASED not built internally. Last year it was 53%. Enterprises tried building. Realized ready-made solutions get to production faster. The 'we'll build it ourselves' confidence is fading. 4/ Startups now capture 63% of AI application market. Up from 36% last year. Incumbents had every structural advantage—distribution, data moats, sales teams—and they're still bleeding market share. 5/ Coding is the killer use case: $4B spend (55% of all departmental AI). Cursor is eating GitHub Copilot's lunch despite Microsoft's entrenched position. How? Model-agnostic approach + faster feature velocity + developer love first. 6/ Anthropic now leads enterprise LLM market: 40% share. OpenAI at 27% (down from 50% in 2023). 18 months of coding dominance with Claude Sonnet created durable enterprise trust. 7/ Bottom line: Enterprises aren't asking 'should we use AI?' anymore. They're asking 'which AI tools should we buy?' If you're building AI-native products, the window is wide open. But velocity > everything. Source: Menlo Ventures 2025 Enterprise AI Report",
  "reddit": "[Discussion] Just read Menlo Ventures' 2025 State of Generative AI in the Enterprise report—here are the numbers that surprised me most **The Scale:** • $37 billion spent on generative AI in 2025 (up 3.2x from $11.5B in 2024) • AI now represents 6% of the entire global SaaS market • All this growth happened within 3 years of ChatGPT's launch **The Adoption Pattern Shift:** 76% of AI solutions are now purchased rather than built internally (was only 53% in 2024). Enterprises tried the DIY route and realized ready-made solutions reach production faster with less headache. **The Conversion Surprise:** AI buyers convert at 47% vs 25% for traditional SaaS deals. Nearly double the conversion rate. The value proposition is immediate and obvious—not speculative roadmaps. **The Startup vs Incumbent Battle:** Startups now capture 63% of AI application revenue (up from 36% last year). Despite incumbents having every structural advantage—distribution, data moats, massive balance sheets—AI-native startups are winning on product velocity. **The Killer Use Case:** Coding is the breakout category: $4B in spend (55% of all departmental AI). 50% of developers now use AI coding tools daily. Companies like Cursor are beating GitHub Copilot by being model-agnostic and shipping faster. **The LLM Market Shake-up:** Anthropic now leads enterprise LLM market with 40% share. OpenAI fell to 27% (from 50% in 2023). 18 months of coding dominance with Claude Sonnet built durable enterprise trust. **Questions for the community:** - Are you seeing this shift toward buying vs building at your company? - Which AI tools have you actually adopted vs just piloted? - Do you think startup momentum in AI apps is sustainable, or will incumbents catch up? - What's your prediction for LLM market share by end of 2025?
