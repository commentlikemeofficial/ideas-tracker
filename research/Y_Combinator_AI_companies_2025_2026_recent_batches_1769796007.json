They imagine AI-native TikTok, infinite gaming worlds, personalized shopping videos, even video calls with loved ones after they\u2019re gone.\n\n3. The First 10-person, $100B Company: Thanks to AI tools, YC believes tiny, high-agency teams (even solo founders) can now build massive companies with minimal funding. The north star metric: revenue per employee.\n\n4. Infrastructure for Multi-Agent Systems: AI is moving from single agents to complex, distributed multi-agent workflows. YC wants infra startups that make deploying + monitoring agent fleets as easy as running a Spark job. [...] 5. AI-Native Enterprise Software: Just like Salesforce & ServiceNow rode the cloud wave, the next $10B+ enterprise companies will be AI-native, not bolt-on AI features slapped onto legacy systems.\n\n6. LLMs vs. Government Consulting: The US spends $100B+ annually on consulting (Deloitte, Accenture, etc.). YC sees massive opportunity for startups to replace bloated gov consulting with LLM-driven solutions.\n\nYC\u2019s big bet: the next wave of unicorns will be AI-first at their core, not AI add-ons.\n\n# Related Answers Section\n\nredditgold\nredditgold\n\nFundraising is hard\n\nAnyone can view, post, and comment to this community [...] r/startups icon\nredditgold\nredditgold\n\nFundraising is hard\n\n# Y Combinator\u2019s New \u201cRequests for Startups\u201d (Fall 2025): AI as the Foundation, Not a Feature - i will not promote\n\nYC just dropped their latest Requests for Startups list, and the theme is clear: the AI hype phase is over. Now it\u2019s about building with it.\n\nSome of the standout ideas they\u2019re excited about:\n\n1. Retraining Workers for the AI Economy: We talk a lot about AI talent, but we\u2019re short on skilled trades (electricians, HVAC, welders) needed for data centers + fabs. YC wants startups building AI-powered vocational schools to retrain workers fast, using AR/VR, multimodal coaching, etc. Think \u201cAI bootcamps\u201d for physical trades.",
