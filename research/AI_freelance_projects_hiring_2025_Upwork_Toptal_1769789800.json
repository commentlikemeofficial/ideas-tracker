For larger teams of talent or full end-to-end project delivery, timelines may vary. Our talent matchers are highly skilled in the same fields they\u2019re matching in\u2014they\u2019re not recruiters or HR reps.

Our matching process has a 98% trial-to-hire rate, so you can rest assured that you\u2019re getting the best fit every time.\n\n### How high is the demand for AI engineers? [...] To choose the best AI expert for your project, you should assess a candidate\u2019s proficiency in programming, data science, mathematics, deep learning frameworks, and cloud computing. They should possess a mastery of one or more programming languages (e.g., Python, R, Java, or C++) and a solid understanding of computer science fundamentals. The required data science skills include knowledge of data structures, algorithms, and ML models, and the necessary mathematical background includes knowledge of linear algebra, calculus, and statistics. Finally, AI experts should have experience with the top deep learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras) and cloud computing platforms (e.g., Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform) to deploy AI models at scale. [...] Challenge: The University of Southern California set out to build a 24/7 mental health app with an authentic, conversational AI chatbot interface and an AI-powered chatbot. To bring this vision to life, the university needed specialized expertise in software development and AI engineers with expertise in chatbot integration.\n\nSolution: In close collaboration with USC\u2019s Institute for Creative Technologies, Toptal helped build Ask Ari, a first-of-its-kind mental health chatbot that uses generative AI to deliver personalized, on-demand support to students.",

Here are some of the best practices and insights from Redditors on how to write clean and maintainable code: [...] ### Documentation and Comments\n\nExplain the \"Why\": Comments should explain the reasoning behind complex logic rather than just restating what the code does. \"Comments shouldn't explain the 'what,' but they can explain the 'why'.\"\n\nAvoid Excessive Comments: Good code should be self-documenting to a large extent. \"Perfect code doesn\u2019t need comments, but perfect code also doesn\u2019t exist.\"\n\n### Code Structure and Formatting\n\nFollow Style Guides: Adhere to coding standards like PEP 8 for Python or Google Style Guides for consistency. \"Starting with PEP8 helps.\"\n\nUse White Space: Properly use white space to separate code blocks and improve readability. \"Use white space to separate code blocks.\"\n\n### Testing and Refactoring",
