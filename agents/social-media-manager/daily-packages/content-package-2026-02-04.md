## HORMOZI FRAMEWORK - LinkedIn

I finally understand how AI "learns." Not the buzzword version. The actual mechanism.

3Blue1Brown's video on gradient descent broke it down so clearly that I can now explain it to my non-technical co-founder. And she actually understood it.

The core insight:
Neural networks don't "think." They minimize error through millions of tiny adjustments. Each adjustment follows the slope of the error landscape downhill—hence "gradient descent."

Think of it like this:
You're blindfolded on a mountain. You want to reach the bottom. So you feel the ground around you, take a step in the steepest downward direction, and repeat. Eventually, you reach a valley.

That's literally how AI learns. No magic. Just math.

The video visualizes this beautifully. You see the algorithm descend into valleys, get stuck in local minima, and eventually find better solutions.

3 takeaways for builders:
1. AI doesn't "understand"—it optimizes. Design your prompts accordingly.
2. Training is just error minimization. More data = better error approximation.
3. Local minima are real. Sometimes you need to shake things up (learning rate adjustments) to find better solutions.

20 minutes. Zero advanced math required. Highest ROI content I've consumed this week.

Watch it before your next AI feature discussion. You'll ask better questions.

### 🐦 X/TWITTER POST (Thread Format)

## NAVAL FRAMEWORK - X/Twitter (Thread)

3Blue1Brown's gradient descent video is the highest-ROI 20 minutes for AI understanding.

The video teaches the core mechanism behind how ALL modern AI learns—not with equations, but with intuition.

Here's the mental model:

Neural networks start random. They make predictions. They measure error. They adjust weights to reduce that error. Millions of times.

Each adjustment follows the gradient (slope) of the error landscape. Go downhill = reduce error. Repeat until you hit a valley.

That's gradient descent. That's how GPT, Claude, and every other AI "learns."

Why this matters:
