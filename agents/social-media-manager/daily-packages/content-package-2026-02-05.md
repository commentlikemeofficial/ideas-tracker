Most local businesses are bleeding $70K/year and don't even know it.

Not from bad service.
From missed calls.

Here's the math:
❌ Human: $4,000/month + 9-5 only
✅ AI: $500/month + 24/7/365

ONE saved HVAC call = $5,000 job.
Your fee = paid for 10 months.

THE OFFER:
→ $1,000 setup
→ $500/month  
→ Guarantee: 3x ROI in 90 days or don't pay

You're not buying AI.
You're buying peace of mind.

What would 5-10 extra bookings/month mean?
