You bought access to software, then applied human judgment and labor to extract value.\n\nAI agents invert this. You specify outcomes. The agent applies computation and synthesized judgment. You verify results.\n\n**Second-Order Effects:**\n\n1. **Pricing collapse of \"productivity\" tools**\n   When AI can replicate your workflow, you're not paying for features—you're paying for the cognitive overhead you avoided. That commands premium pricing, but destroys feature-based business models.\n\n2. **Bundling → Unbundling → Rebundling (at agent layer)**\n   We saw this with mobile. Single-purpose SaaS thrived. Now AI agents are rebundling entire workflows into outcome-as-a-service.\n\n3. **The moat moves to data + distribution**\n   API access and UI polish become commodities. What matters: proprietary data that improves agent performance, and distribution channels to reach buyers who want outcomes, not tools.\n\n**The Contrarian Take:**\n\nSaaS isn't dying. It's becoming invisible infrastructure. The best AI agents will run on standardized backends while competing on prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and vertical specialization.\n\nThe winners won't be the ones building the shiniest agents. They'll be the ones who own the distribution when buyers decide to stop managing software and start buying results.\n\nWhat's your take? Are we overestimating near-term agent capabilities, or underestimating the speed of this transition?\n","path":"/home/ubuntu/clawd/contentclaw/tracking/2026-02-05/reddit-post.md"}}],"api":"openai-completions","provider":"kimi-code","model":"kimi-k2.5","usage":{"input":7857,"output":1227,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"totalTokens":9084,"cost":{"input":0,"output":0,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0}},"stopReason":"toolUse","timestamp":1770269140185}}
