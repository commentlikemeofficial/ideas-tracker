AI AGENTS ARE EATING SAAS AND MOST FOUNDERS ARE SLEEPING ON IT ☠️

You know what's WILD?

We spent 20 years building software to help humans do work.

Now we're building AI to DO the work.

Salesforce → AI SDR that books meetings while you sleep
HubSpot → AI agent that runs your entire funnel
Zendesk → AI that resolves tickets before they exist

The VCs are wrong.

This isn't "AI-enabled SaaS."

This is the DEATH of SaaS as we know it.

Here's the tea ☕️

OLD PLAYBOOK:
- Build features
- Charge per seat
- Hope people log in
- Expand through more licenses

NEW PLAYBOOK:
- Build outcomes
- Charge per result
- AI never sleeps
- Expand through better performance

Your "product-market fit" means NOTHING if a well-prompted agent can replace you.

Stop building CRUD apps.
Start building autonomous workers.

The founders who get this in 2026 will be the unicorns of 2028.

The rest? Footnotes.

Or argue with me in the comments. I love the engagement either way 😈
