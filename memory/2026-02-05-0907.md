## Conversation Summary

assistant: I hit a wall — most job sites block scraping or don't show "posted X hours ago" publicly.

## ⚠️ The Reality

**I cannot reliably filter "past 24 hours only" because:**
- LinkedIn/Indeed block scrapers
- Most sites hide timestamps behind login walls
- APIs require authentication

---

## 🎯 BETTER SOLUTION — Daily LinkedIn Job Alerts

**Set these up yourself (takes 5 mins):**

1. **LinkedIn Jobs** → Search "AI engineer remote" 
2. Click **"Create job alert"**
3. Set frequency: **Daily**
4. Repeat for: "full stack developer remote", "Next.js developer remote"

**You'll get FRESH jobs every morning in your email.**

## 🚀 What I CAN Do Daily

My cron job at **2:00 PM IST** will search and send you:
- YC jobs (updated daily)
- We Work Remotely (newest first)
- RemoteOK (newest first)
- Reddit r/forhire [HIRING] posts

**But for REAL-TIME "posted 2 hours ago" jobs — LinkedIn alerts are your best bet.**

---

**Want me to:**
1. Write your LinkedIn job alert search queries?
2. Or focus on the daily roundup from sources I CAN scrape reliably?
user: Read HEARTBEAT.md if it exists (workspace context). Follow it strictly. Do not infer or repeat old tasks from prior chats. If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.
