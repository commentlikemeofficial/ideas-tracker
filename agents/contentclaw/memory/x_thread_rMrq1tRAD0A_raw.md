🧵 The $37B AI wave is here—and the data reveals where the market is actually heading:

1/ Just read Menlo Ventures' 2025 Enterprise AI Report. 

Key numbers that stopped me cold:
• $37B spent on generative AI in 2025 (3.2x growth from 2024)
• AI now = 6% of entire global SaaS market
• All this happened in just 3 years post-ChatGPT

2/ The most striking stat:

AI buyers convert at 47% vs 25% for traditional SaaS.

Nearly 2x higher conversion. Why? Value is immediate. Not speculative. Not "maybe next quarter." Right now productivity gains.

3/ Another surprise: 76% of AI solutions are PURCHASED not built internally.

Last year it was 53%. Enterprises tried building. Realized ready-made solutions get to production faster.

The "we'll build it ourselves" confidence is fading.

4/ Startups now capture 63% of AI application market.

Up from 36% last year.

Incumbents had every structural advantage—distribution, data moats, sales teams—and they're still bleeding market share.

5/ Coding is the killer use case: $4B spend (55% of all departmental AI).

Cursor is eating GitHub Copilot's lunch despite Microsoft's entrenched position.

How? Model-agnostic approach + faster feature velocity + developer love first.

6/ Anthropic now leads enterprise LLM market: 40% share.

OpenAI at 27% (down from 50% in 2023).

18 months of coding dominance with Claude Sonnet created durable enterprise trust.

7/ Bottom line:

Enterprises aren't asking "should we use AI?" anymore.

They're asking "which AI tools should we buy?"

If you're building AI-native products, the window is wide open.

But velocity > everything.
