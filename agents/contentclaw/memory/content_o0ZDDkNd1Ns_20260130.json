  "reddit": "[Discussion] AI Trends & Enterprise Adoption 2025 - Key insights Just came across this video and wanted to share the key points with the community: AI adoption is accelerating in 2025. Enterprises spent $37B on generative AI. Vertical AI solutions are winning over horizontal ones. Compliance is becoming essential infrastructure. Indian enterprises are rapidly adopting AI for regulatory compliance.. **My take:** We're at an inflection point where AI compliance is moving from \"experimental\" to \"essential infrastructure.\" As someone building in this space (AI-powered DPDPA compliance for Indian enterprises).
