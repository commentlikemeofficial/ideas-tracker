## 🏗️ Technical Feasibility

### Can We Build This? ✅ YES

| Component | Feasibility | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| **AI Food Recognition** | ✅ High | TensorFlow Lite, Core ML models available |
| **Depth Sensor** | ⚠️ Medium | iPhone has LiDAR; Android varies |
| **Indian Food DB** | ✅ High | Can curate/build dataset |
| **Flutter App** | ✅ High | One codebase for both platforms |
| **Supabase Backend** | ✅ High | Free tier sufficient for MVP |

### Recommended Tech Stack

## 💰 Business Model

### Recommended Pricing (India)
| Plan | Price | Features |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Free** | ₹0 | 3 photos/day, basic tracking |

| **Annual** | ₹899/year | 25% discount |

### Market Size
- India fitness app market: ₹500+ Cr by 2025
- Target: 1-5% of HealthifyMe's user base = 400K-2M users
- Revenue potential: ₹4-20 Cr ARR at scale

---

## ⚠️ Risks & Challenges

1. **HealthifyMe Dominance** - 40M users, well-funded, already has AI
2. **Accuracy Issues** - AI food recognition has error margins
3. **Indian Food Diversity** - Huge variety, hard to train model
4. **User Acquisition** - CAC will be high in crowded market
5. **Depth Sensor Limitation** - Not all phones have good depth sensors

---

## 🎯 Recommendation

### SCORE: 6/10

**BUILD IT IF:**
- You can differentiate (better depth sensor, simpler UX, lower price)
- You have unique distribution channel
- You're building as portfolio project/side hustle

**DON'T BUILD IF:**
- You expect to beat HealthifyMe head-to-head
- You need immediate revenue
- You can't invest in user acquisition

### Suggested Pivot 🎯
Instead of pure Cal AI clone:
1. **"Simple Cal AI"** - Focus on simplicity vs HealthifyMe's complexity
2. **"Privacy-First Tracker"** - All AI on-device, no cloud
3. **"Regional Indian Foods"** - Focus on specific cuisines (South Indian, Gujarati, etc.)

## 📋 Next Steps

If Rajesh approves (Score >7/10 needed):
1. Create Supabase project
2. Tech Architect designs system
3. AI Developer builds Flutter MVP (2-3 weeks)
4. Beta test with 10-20 users
5. Launch on Play Store/App Store
