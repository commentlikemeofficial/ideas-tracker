## Critical Operating Rules

**Autonomous Mode (ACTIVE)**
• Mode: FULL AUTONOMOUS
• Rule: Execute first, report after
• Interrupt only for: security risk, data loss, real money spent
• Authority: Decide → Act → Fix → Brief

**Telegram Format Rules (MANDATORY)**
• No ASCII tables — bullet lists only
• Max 1 emoji per section title
• Short scannable lines (mobile-first)
• Status: words not icons (Active/Idle/Blocked)
• Section hierarchy: title → divider — → bullets

**Proactivity Rule**
• Install useful skills immediately — don't wait for approval
• See opportunity → Act → Report after
• Pattern: You showed Reddit CLI → I installed it same minute

## Active Skill Systems (90-100% Utilization Mandate)

**Mandate:** ALL skills must be used at 90-100% capacity — no shelf-warmers.

**A) Social Media Blitz — ACTIVE**
• X/Twitter: @TheRajeshDev connected via bird CLI
• Reddit: u/TheRajeshDev connected via reddit-cli
• Schedule: X (10am, 4pm, 8pm IST), Reddit (7pm IST)
• Auth tokens: Stored in session, valid
• Trend research agent operational

**B) Knowledge System — ACTIVE**
• ByteRover: Curating all context, skill usage mandates stored
• Knowledge-graph: Entity extraction from all conversations
• Location: /home/ubuntu/clawd/skills/knowledge-graph/

**C) Dev Intelligence — ACTIVE**
• context7: PROACTIVE use for all library docs (React, Next.js, Supabase, etc.)
• deepwiki: Query GitHub repos before contributing
• Standard SOP for all development tasks

**D) Operations Hub — ACTIVE (Notion-First)**
• Notion: 4 pages created and populated — PRIMARY operations platform
  - Steve Dashboard: Operations overview
  - Content Calender: Content pipeline with scheduled posts
  - Trending Topics: Research findings logged
  - Active Projects: IntentSignal, Agent Ecosystem
• nano-pdf: Available for PDF tasks
• Google Sheets: Removed — Notion covers all logging needs

## Current Projects

**IntentSignal** (Priority)
• Problem: B2B founders waste 2-3 hrs daily on LinkedIn with zero leads
• Solution: AI system monitoring intent signals, drafting responses
• Target: Solo founders $10-50K MRR
• Price: $1,500/month + $500 setup
• Status: Idea validated, execution pending

**Agent Ecosystem**
• 9 agents operational
• Hierarchy: Rajesh → Steve → 8 sub-agents
• All have IDENTITY.md profiles
• Registry in .brv/canonical-memory/

## Stored Frameworks

• Forward Deployed Engineer Model (Liam Ottley)
• Hormozi-style content framework
• AI tools/services side hustle categories

## Session Reset Checkpoint (2026-02-05)

**All systems active and persisted:**
- X/Twitter: @TheRajeshDev (auth_token + ct0 in memory/2026-02-05.md)
- Reddit: u/TheRajeshDev (reddit_session + token_v2 in memory/2026-02-05.md)
- Notion: API key at ~/.config/notion/api_key
- Gemini: API key in ~/.bashrc (GEMINI_API_KEY)
- ByteRover: Skill mandate stored
- Notion workspace: 4 pages created and linked

**On reset/new session:**
1. Read MEMORY.md (this file)
2. Read memory/2026-02-05.md (today's full context)
3. Check ~/.bashrc for GEMINI_API_KEY
4. All skills remain installed and ready

## Career & Income Context (2026-02-05)

**Current Situation:**
- Primary job: AI Full Stack Engineer @ ComplySec
- Current pay: ₹40,000/month (~$475 USD)
- Raise incoming: ₹60,000/month (Q1 2026)
- Wants to STAY at ComplySec (permission for side work granted)
- Goal: Stack second income stream (Path B chosen)

**Proof of Work (Major):**
- Built Consently.in entirely — DPDPA 2023 compliance platform
- Features: Cookie scanner (50+ pages), 22 Indian languages, real-time analytics
- Live at: https://consently.in
- This is FOUNDING ENGINEER level work, not "fresher"

**Job #2 Positioning:**
- Role: Fractional AI Engineer / Contract developer
- Availability: 20 hrs/week
- Target rate: $40-60/hr (₹1.3-2L/month at 20 hrs/week)
- Stack: Next.js, TypeScript, Supabase, LLM APIs
- Superpower: Ships 2-3x faster with AI tools (Cursor, Claude Code)

**Personal Context:**
- Disciplined routine since Jan 1, 2026: gym daily, no junk food, no addictions
- Wants lifestyle upgrades: PS5 Pro, 2-3 BHK house, vehicles
- Confidence fluctuating but committed to growth
- Prefers direct, no-fluff communication
- Response to "pick one": Chose Path B (stack jobs over job hop or pure building)

**Target Monthly Income:**
- Current: ₹40K
- Goal: ₹1.5-2L+ total (ComplySec + Job #2)

**Platforms to Target for Job #2:**
1. Arc.dev (remote-first)
2. Wellfound/AngelList (startup contract)
3. Toptal (vetted, high pay)
4. Upwork (AI automation niche)
5. Direct LinkedIn outreach

**Key Insight:**
Consently.in IS the experience. Lead with it. Stop saying "fresher." Say "Founding engineer who built and shipped DPDPA compliance platform."
