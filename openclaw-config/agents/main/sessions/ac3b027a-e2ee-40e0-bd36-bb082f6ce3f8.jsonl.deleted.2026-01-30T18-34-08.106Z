You don't give a about introductions in my YouTube video or even who I am. You came here to learn about how to make money with Claudebot and Moldbot. I'm not going to waste your time. I know your time is valuable. So, let's get right into it. The first idea to make money with Claudebot with Maltbot or with any AI assistant for that matter is this. Use it to set up AI consultants and assistants for local businesses. Let me explain. You're going to turn AI into a 24/7 receptionist for real businesses. Now, given that it's 2026, given that a lot of the world doesn't want to work, I mean, after CO, you know how it's been, guys. After CO, people have gotten lazy. Chat GBT has made people lazy. Uh, you know, lazy people are lazy because they're lazy. And this is just the way it is. It's not the 1980s anymore. AI is taking over. And the sooner that you learn how to use AI, the more money that you can make. And let me explain why. Moldbot, Claudebot, previously known as that, replies instantly to SMS and WhatsApp for businesses. It answers customer questions 24/7. It books appointments automatically. Now, let me explain why this is so valuable and why this basically sells itself. Here's the opportunity. You turn missed leads into leads missed no more. What do I mean by that? Well, small businesses lose revenue daily, not due to poor service, but because they're too busy to respond. And here's the core problem. business owners. And if you've ever been a business owner like I have, we juggle operations, there's marketing, there's customer care, there's it's just there there's no time for responses. And we just get so wrapped up with everyday activities that it just by the time that we get home, we crash and burn. All we want to do is drink a beer and watch Netflix. What's the real cost? Well, for a dentist, as an example, a missed appointment means $150 to $300 in lost revenue. for a contractor like an HVAC contractor or a plumber that can be a $5,000 or $10,000 missed call. Here's the AI solution. It's a simple no code tool like Moldbot that acts as a real-time receptionist on SMS and WhatsApp replying even at 2 a.m. most businesses and I paused because I just the the opportunity here is so immense. If you're an HVAC contractor and you miss a call from Rebecca in in the middle of a Phoenix summer whose family is suffering because their air conditioner broke at at 3 p.m. and now it's 107° in the house. You have a baby. She has a baby that's screaming. Everyone's sweating. Everyone is in danger. They're in literal danger because Phoenix summers and summers all over the United States and the world can get super hot. If Rebecca calls a contractor, an HVAC contractor, and they don't pick up the phone, guess what's happening? She's not going to wait for you to call them back. She's not going to wait for her baby to suffer. She's calling your competitor. She's calling the competitor of the plumber. She's calling the competitor of the lawyer. The the the the person who just got in a car accident needs a lawyer. The person who's getting arrested needs a lawyer. The person who needs a doctor needs a doctor now. And if businesses don't pick up their phone, guess what? They're calling their competitors. That's $100 lost. That's $2,000 lost. That's $10,000 lost from a single missed call. So AI delivers the same function as front desk staff at a fraction of the cost. At a fraction of the cost. If a business is paying Becky, who is a 19-year-old teenager, to show up to work drunk, hung over with an attitude. If the business is paying her $4,000 a month and you charge them $1,000 a month for an AI employee that works 24/7, 365 around the clock, doesn't call off sick, doesn't come in drunk, doesn't have attitude, doesn't uh ask for insurance, doesn't whatever the case may be. Human problems. Human problems. If you charge them $1,000 a month and you save them $3,000 a month for an AI employee that can do Becky's job a thousand times better and 100 times faster, guess what? You're getting the business every time. So, here's how the setup actually works. It's a simple repeatable process. You pick a niche. You gather key info. You connect Moldbot, Claudebot. You train with frequently asked questions. And then you test. You test. and then you test and then you test some more. The reason is because you want confidence when it comes to the business. You want to be able to know that your AI bot is going to answer every single question and it's going to be ready for business. It's going to be ready to go to war. Choose your niche, gather key information, connect mult train, test and launch. You didn't build the software, guys. A genius built it. I mean, obviously this guy is super smart. You installed leverage. Let's talk about the steps. We choose our niche. Now, I want you to choose one single niche. I don't want you to hop around niches like I do. I used to be somebody who grasped at multiple stars per week. And it's just this shiny new thing that comes along. I grasp at it knowing that I have entrepreneurial ADD. Here's what I mean. If you pick dentists, stick with dentists. If you pick contractor, stick with contractors. HVAC and plumbing. real estate agents, lawyers, etc., etc. Step number two, gather five pieces of info on the business. Here's what I mean. Services offered, pricing details, operating hours, of course, frequently asked questions, and a booking link. And for Christ's sake, get a booking link, guys. Because if you contact a business and they don't have a booking link, a lot of times you're going to lose that customer. Because if you don't have something to sell, if you don't have something for them to fill out their information and add their credit card, they're not going to do it. They're going to go to their competitors. Because customers want to feel like they're being cared for. They want to feel like you're attending them. If you go to a restaurant and the server barely comes by your table and asks how you're doing, guess what? They're probably going to get a shitty tip. This is the way it is. Businesses as well. Step number three, install maltb. I can't I can't say that. I always I always have trouble saying that. and connect your channels. Sign up for Mobot, connect businesses, SMS, WhatsApp, and activate their AI assistant. Steps super simple. Sign up, connect their phone number, confirm ownership, activate the AI assistant. Step number four, train the AI with real answers. Paste facts into Mulbot. No templates, just real business language with accurate replies. And here's an example training session. You could say something like, \"The customer says, \"Do you accept insurance?\" You train it to say this. \"What are your hours?\" You train it to say this. \"How much is cleaning?\" You train it to say this. Basically, when you sign up with a business, they're going to send you a sheet, a PDF of their frequently asked questions. As much as they can. The more that you train this bot, the better it works and the more efficient and the more money it can make the business. So, as soon as you sign up with a business and you ask for their frequently asked questions, they send you a list, preferably in a PDF and you feed this into Mullebot and not only does Mulbot uh absorb the frequently asked questions and and spit them back out when the customer asks for them, but it gets smarter as customers interact with it. It actually gets smarter. And if you guys have heard of GoHigh Level, Gohigh Level is is a software service. It's a CRM service that basically has an AI assistant, but the AI assistant is not like Moltbot. It's not like Claudebot because it doesn't learn. It doesn't get smarter. And it's I get so much for saying this. Maltbot is the first step in AGI. It's actually artificial general intelligence. It responds, it learns, it it produces, it cooperates, it it expands, it transcends, it improves and every every echelon possible, you know, given its its specific parameters at least. But that to me is AGI. And if you don't think this is AGI, I don't know what you think AGI is. But of course, I mean, in the future, there's going to be better uh uh real real life AGI like the movie Her with Scarlett Johansson and Walking Phoenix. But this this is the beginning of it, guys. And I just I get so excited thinking about this. Like last [snorts] night I was laying in my bed. I couldn't sleep. I was just thinking about the possibilities of this AI assistant moldbot or or all the AI assist I can't even talk straight. All the AI assistance assistants to come in the future. The possibilities that this can do. Anything that a human can do is absolutely incredible. I can't believe it's here. Like we were all  our pants when Chachi BT came around. Now this is 100 times better than chachi given that it runs on the brain of cha but a lot of people say that it's a wrapped API. I don't give a to me it's AGI. I like to be optimistic and I think that this is the beginning of something beautiful. This is the beginning of a human human uh AI relationship that can create single person company billionaires. Just it's so great to think about. Step number five, test and launch. Send a test message to verify responses. Make sure booking links work, availability, and then go live with confidence. Super important that you have confidence in your product. I mean, obviously, you're going to send the test message. You're going to make sure the AI responds. You're going to check the booking link. Double triple check the booking link to make sure it works. Then you're going to go live. What to verify during testing, guys? Accuracy of responses to common questions. Proper formatting of booking links. correct availability showing in response real-time calendar synchronization. And of course, you always want to make this sure this works because if somebody books something on the business calendar, you want it to go through. I mean, otherwise, what are we doing? If you have an emergency plumbing issue in your house and your house is flooding and you call a plumber, guess what? The plumber doesn't pick up, you're not waiting around for them. You're not going to leave a voicemail. What is this, 1980s? You're not going to uh wait for them to pick up after six rings. It's just you're not going to do it. It's an emergency. So, guess what? If they don't pick up on the sixth or seventh ring, you're calling their competitor. The same thing with an HVAC company. The same thing with a doctor or a lawyer or a dentist or companies and businesses that rely on calls and people actually calling in or texting in. If you call an emergency service like an HVAC or a plumber and they don't pick up, that's $5,000 lost. That's $10,000 lost. So, if you charge these companies a onetime setup fee for $500 to $2,000. I mean, you can charge them whatever you want in accordance to what their missed calls are worth. Let's say you you split it in the middle. Let's say you charge them $1,000 setup fee and you do a monthly management of $100 to $300. Uh let's let's make it a little higher. Let's say you charge them $500 per month for monthly management. So essentially, they're paying a $1,000 setup fee plus $500 a month. If you can get them only one call, let's say you're working for an HVAC company, for example. If you can get them only one call, one call that they otherwise would have missed at 7:00 p.m. when nobody was in the office, and that call leads to a $5,000 air conditioner installation. Your service has paid for itself times two, times three. A lot of profit on that one call. Otherwise, they would have missed it and they wouldn't have made a single dime. You can charge them what you want, guys. This is a super easy business. Even if you charge them $500 and $300 monthly management, it's a no-brainer. It's a no-brainer for these businesses. And I think the service sells itself. The AI sells itself. All you need to do is make them see the value. you know, explain it to them like they are going to lose uh $200,000 a year if they don't have the service because they are. And on average, I I forgot what the number was, but plumbers and HVAC lose on average, I'd say 70,000 per year from missed calls. And whether that be somebody calling at 9:00 p.m. and nobody's in the office or Becky's on her lunch break and she can't pick up the phone or uh uh Jonathan who's an intern secretary shows up late or whatever the case may be, miss calls equals money down the drain. Period. And businesses know this. So if you can answer every single call, if you can tag every single customer and text them back or just be like, \"Hey, this is ABC Plumbing. I know we missed your call. How can we help you? How much money can you make the company back? How much money can you save them? How much time and headache? It's just if you can communicate the value to these companies, guess what? You have yourself a client. Here's the real value, guys. It's peace of mind. It's not AI. People don't care about AI. As a matter of fact, so many people are scared of AI. When you say AI, they think of Chat GBT and they think of Terminator and Skynet and AI taking over the world and it's going to enslave us like the Matrix when Neo was in that liquid bubble. whatever it was. When people think of AI, I think most people get scared because they've been programmed or conditioned or or whatever the case may be to think of AI as something that is negative. But the only thing businesses care about is results. They don't care how you dug the hole. Whether you use the spoon or a a back hoe, they don't care. As long as the hole is dug, as long as the job gets done, that's all businesses care about. So clients don't pay for technology. They pay for reliability, responsiveness, and confidence. Confidence. Confidence is the key. Reliability. Every lead is answered instantly. In the day of Tik Tok and YouTube and Instagram, nobody has patience for anything. As a matter of fact, there was a recent survey that says most people on social media, most people in general have the average attention span of a goldfish, which is exactly 6 seconds. It's sad. I know. We can use this as an advantage to make money. No more missed calls, no more delayed messages. Responsiveness. Clients expect responses within 10 minutes. As a matter of fact, it's shorter. They respect expect responses within a minute. If not, they're going to their competitors. The AI assistant delivers instant replies when it matters most. Peace of mind. Those sweet, sweet words, peace of mind. Business owners can focus on what they do best while knowing their communication gap is filled. You're not selling AI, guys. You're selling peace of mind. The confidence that every lead, day or night, is answered instantly, professionally, and reliably. This isn't about technology. It's about transformation. And most of all, it's about money, obviously. So, it doesn't matter what niche you're going after. Stick to one niche. dentists, doctors, lawyers, HVAC, plumbing, electricians, massage therapists, uh, gym coaches, um, real estate agents. All of these businesses are million and billion dollar businesses, and they're losing millions of billions of dollars every year because of missed calls, because of human error. Now, like I said, just I believe that AI can take the place of humans, not in a in a weird dystopian way, but in in a synergistic, synchronistic, symbiotic type of way where we can become one with AI. We can run our business and let AI do the boring, repetitive tasks that bring us the most amount of uh productivity and money while incorporating the human side of our business. We can work together. It doesn't have to be one or the other. We don't have to, you know, it doesn't have to be black or white, do or die, where AI replaces humans completely. I mean, it might come to that one day, but for now, just breathe. This is what it is, guys. AI is helping us out. And you can help out small businesses. You can help businesses save time, save money, and make tons of money. And guess what? If you provide massive amounts of value to that business, that business is going to stick around and that business is going to refer you to other businesses. Those businesses will refer you to other businesses. Other businesses will refer you to their friends. Their friends will will refer you to their family. This is the way the business works. The best lead magnet is word of mouth, hands down, because the trust barrier is already gone. If Bob, who owns a plumbing shop, talks to his friend Todd, which owns an HVAC shop, and says, \"Hey, by the way, Johnny is great. He made me a lot of money, and he saved me a lot of time.\" Guess what? Todd already has that trust factor established with Bob. So, he's going to be like, \"Yeah, send me his contact info. Let's get him in the door right away.\" That's another client like that. no selling, no marketing, no cold cold ads, cold leads, cold calls, cold, nothing like that. You're already in the door. So, the more value that you provide, the more money that you can make. And it's like a snowball effect. It's it's an absolutely beautiful exponential roller coaster ride that we can get on and just keep going. Become an entrepreneur, start our own business, start start somewhere, but just start. Remember, one post, one phone call, one client gained is better than an idea any day. I hope you enjoyed the video, guys.

The surge crowned Nvidia the world’s most valuable company.[1](https://menlovc.com/perspective/2025-the-state-of-generative-ai-in-the-enterprise/#4e03a784-4a54-4f8f-a3a1-cc36827fe026) Foundation models announced close to **$1 trillion** in AI infrastructure commitments. Venture funding surged back toward all-time highs, with nearly half of it concentrated in just a handful of frontier AI labs.\n\nThen the euphoria peaked. An [MIT study](https://mlq.ai/media/quarterly_decks/v0.1_State_of_AI_in_Business_2025_Report.pdf) [2](https://menlovc.com/perspective/2025-the-state-of-generative-ai-in-the-enterprise/#55ec2039-4e62-4d4d-abb2-629eb0d1be67) claiming that **95%** of generative AI initiatives fail rattled markets over the summer, exposing how quickly sentiment could shift beneath the weight of AI’s massive capex spend. The whispers of a bubble became a din.\n\nThe concerns aren’t unfounded given the magnitude of the numbers being thrown around. But the demand side tells a different story: Our latest market data shows broad adoption, real revenue, and productivity gains at scale, signaling a boom versus a bubble.\n\n[![Enterprise AI is the fastest-scaling software category in history](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/0-enterprise_ai_growth.webp)](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/0-enterprise_ai_growth.webp) Enterprise AI has surged from $1.7B to $37B since 2023, now capturing 6% of the global SaaS market and growing faster than any software category in history.\n\n_For Menlo’s third annual State of Generative AI in the Enterprise report, we surveyed ~500 U.S. enterprise decision-makers and combined their insights with a bottoms-up model of the generative AI market spanning model APIs, infrastructure, and applications. Since 2023, our team has tracked AI’s evolution from early experiments to broad enterprise deployment, giving us a multi-year view of the speed and scale of this transformation._\n\n### **Follow the Money: Where Do Enterprise Dollars Flow?**\n\nOur data indicates companies spent **$37 billion** on generative AI in 2025,[3](https://menlovc.com/perspective/2025-the-state-of-generative-ai-in-the-enterprise/#b80db139-f442-4176-8179-56de9fa744e8) up from **$11.5 billion** [4](https://menlovc.com/perspective/2025-the-state-of-generative-ai-in-the-enterprise/#bac4b9dd-2752-467b-9bf4-3f4f06cca02e) in 2024, a **3.2x** year-over-year increase. The largest share, **$19 billion**, went to the user-facing products and software that leverage underlying AI models, aka the application layer. This represents more than **6%** of the entire software market, all achieved within three years of [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)’s launch.\n\nGrowth extends far beyond a handful of AI chat apps, touching every domain in the economy. By our count, there are now at least **10 products** generating over **$1 billion in ARR** and **50 products** generating over **$100 million in ARR**, led by the model APIs powering applications ( [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/)\\*, [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), [Google](https://gemini.google.com/)), but increasingly distributed across departmental solutions in coding, sales, customer support, HR, and verticals from healthcare and legal to the creator economy.\n\n[![Generative AI spend by category: 2023-2025](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1-genai_spend_by_category-120825-scaled.webp)](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1-genai_spend_by_category-120825-scaled.webp) In 2025, more than half of enterprise AI spend went to AI applications, indicating that modern enterprises are prioritizing immediate productivity gains vs. long-term infrastructure bets.\n\n### **How AI Enters the Enterprise: The Path to Production**\n\nAfter three years, enterprise AI’s path to production has taken shape. Early adopters had no playbook. Now, distinct patterns have emerged that break from traditional SaaS. Enterprises prefer buying over building, showing stronger purchase intent, and adopting AI through product-led growth at a scale rarely seen in enterprise software.\n\n### **Enterprises Are Buying More Than Building**\n\nFor a while, the prevailing wisdom was that enterprises would build most AI solutions themselves. Bloombergtrained [BloombergGPT](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/press/bloomberggpt-50-billion-parameter-llm-tuned-finance/) for finance in 2022, Walmartbuilt [Wallaby](https://corporate.walmart.com/news/2024/10/09/walmart-reveals-plan-for-scaling-artificial-intelligence-generative-ai-augmented-reality-and-immersive-commerce-experiences) for retail in 2024. Teams were confident that, with the right data, domain expertise, and scaffolding, they could handle everything in-house.\n\nIn [2024](https://menlovc.com/2024-the-state-of-generative-ai-in-the-enterprise/), that confidence still showed in the data: **47%** of AI solutions were built internally, **53%** purchased.[5](https://menlovc.com/perspective/2025-the-state-of-generative-ai-in-the-enterprise/#8d1f4365-11bc-415d-a0d6-8a5ba43b2f18) Today, **76%** of AI use cases are purchased rather than built internally. Despite continued strong investments in internal builds, ready-made AI solutions are reaching production more quickly and demonstrating immediate value while enterprise tech stacks continue to mature.\n\n[![Building vs. buying enterprise AI solutions: 2024 vs. 2025](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2-building_vs_buying-scaled.webp)](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2-building_vs_buying-scaled.webp) Last year, enterprises were split on building vs. buying. Today, enterprises have more ready-made AI solutions in production as their internal builds mature.\n\n### **AI Buyers Convert at Higher Rates**\n\nEnterprise buyers approach AI with notably high intent. We found that, once an organization commits to exploring an AI solution, deals convert at nearly twice the rate of traditional software: **47%** of AI deals go to production, compared to **25%** for traditional SaaS. That elevated conversion reflects strong buyer commitment and clear immediate value. Our survey data reveals that most organizations surface a long list of potential AI use cases—often **10** or more—but focus their adoption on near-term productivity gains or cost savings. While enterprises identify slightly more internal-facing use cases( **59%**) than customer-facing ones ( **41%**), both categories move through the pipeline at nearly identical rates, suggesting that operational AI investments deliver value just as reliably as customer-facing innovations.\n\n[![Conversion rate of AI buyers vs. traditional software buyers](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/3-ai_buyers_vs_saas_buyers-scaled.webp)](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/3-ai_buyers_vs_saas_buyers-scaled.webp) AI buyers convert at 47% vs. SaaS’ conversion rate of 25%, indicating that AI delivers enough immediate value to short-circuit standard procurement processes.\n\n### **PLG: Individual Users Now Drive AI Adoption at 4x the Rate of Software**\n\nOutside of centralized procurement channels, AI solutions are increasingly finding their initial “land” in the enterprise through individual users rather than the enterprise executive. We found that **27%** of all AI application spend comes through product-led growth (PLG) motions, nearly **4x** the rate in traditional software ( **7%**).\n\nAnd that number is conservative. When we account for “shadow AI adoption”—employees using personal credit cards for tools like [ChatGPT Plus](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-G7TYuJJCE-gpt-plus), where roughly **27%** of usage is work-related[6](https://menlovc.com/perspective/2025-the-state-of-generative-ai-in-the-enterprise/#f33a028a-0597-4b44-9ef5-2754bd2c24bc)—PLG-driven tools may represent close to **40%** of application AI spend.\n\n[![Product-led growth (PLG) as a percentage of AI spend](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/4-plg_ai_adoption-scaled.webp)](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/4-plg_ai_adoption-scaled.webp) In AI, PLG motions reach and convert enterprise users far faster than traditional SaaS. Real usage proves value well before any formal contracting process begins.\n\nIn AI, PLG motions are reaching enterprise scale faster and going further than in traditional SaaS. [Cursor](https://cursor.com/) reached **$200 million** in revenue before hiring a single enterprise sales rep. [n8n](https://n8n.io/) built its business on open-source community adoption, formalizing contracts only after hundreds of employees were already active users. [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/), [Gamma](https://www.gamma.app/), and [Wispr Flow](https://wisprflow.ai/)\\\\* scaled in the same way.\n\nDevelopers and technical teams are especially receptive to this motion. Many discover tools for individual use, prove their value in day-to-day work, and create bottom-up demand that eventually converts to enterprise contracts. [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/), [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/)\\*, and [fal](https://fal.ai/) follow this pattern, turning informal adoption by product managers and engineers into enterprise agreements once the tools are embedded in development workflows.\n\n### **Startups vs. Incumbents: New Entrants Gain Ground in AI Apps**\n\nAt the AI application layer, startups have pulled decisively ahead. This year, according to our data, they captured nearly $2 in revenue for every $1 earned by incumbents— **63%** of the market, up from **36%** [last year](https://menlovc.com/2024-the-state-of-generative-ai-in-the-enterprise/) [7](https://menlovc.com/perspective/2025-the-state-of-generative-ai-in-the-enterprise/#01521709-fdd6-4710-b410-35ae63aff480) when enterprises still held the lead.\n\nOn paper, this shouldn’t be happening. Incumbents have entrenched distribution, data moats, deep enterprise relationships, scaled sales teams, and massive balance sheets. Yet, in practice, AI-native startups are out-executing much larger competitors across some of the fastest-growing app categories.\n\n- **Product + engineering**( **71%** startup share): Code generation is the canonical example for why startups win. [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) was the first mover and had every structural advantage, yet Cursorcaptured significant share by shipping better features, faster—beating Copilot to repo-level context, multi-file editing, diff approvals, and natural language commands. Cursor’s model-agnostic approach let developers adopt frontier models like Claude Sonnet 3.5 the moment they launched, rather than being limited by Microsoft’s partner choices. That product velocity created a PLG flywheel: Cursor won the ground game with individual developers, who then brought it into the enterprise.\n- **Sales**( **78%** startup share): AI-native startups like [Clay](https://www.clay.com/) and [Actively](https://www.actively.ai/) win by attacking workflows Salesforcedoesn’t own: research, personalization, and enrichment, which rely heavily on unstructured signals (web, social, email) that sit outside the CRM. By owning these off-CRM surfaces and expanding downstream, they become the AI layer reps actually interface with—disintermediating the legacy system of record in the near term and positioning themselves to potentially become the system of record in the long term.\n- **Finance + operations**( **91%** startup share): In highly regulated domains like finance, incumbents like Intuit QuickBooksface high demands for accuracy that slow their ability to ship AI-native workflows. Although the total dollars here are still small, this paralysis creates a vacuum for startups like [Rillet](https://www.rillet.com/), [Campfire](https://campfire.ai/), and [Numeric](https://www.numeric.io/)\\\\* downmarket to build AI-first ERPs with real-time automation and intelligent workflows—winning because the incumbent cannot move fast enough to deliver a credible next-gen product.\n\nThe chart below shows how this dynamic varies across enterprise departments, each with its own function-specific tooling. Teams grappling with fragmented, data-heavy workflows that lend themselves to automation lead AI adoption. Incumbents remain stronger where reliability, integration depth, and existing system dependencies outweigh the benefits of rapid iteration.\n\n[![Departmental AI: startup vs. incumbent market share](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/5-departmental_ai-startups_vs_incumbents-scaled.webp)](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/5-departmental_ai-startups_vs_incumbents-scaled.webp) AI startups thrive in agile departments like market research, sales, marketing, and product. Incumbents hold their ground in IT and data science, where reliability and deep integrations outweigh speed.\n\nThe story changes as we move down the stack. At the infrastructure layer, the picture is more mixed. According to our data, incumbents hold **56%** of the market as many AI app builders continue building on the data platforms they’ve trusted for years. Although new AI-native infrastructure companies like [Temporal](https://temporal.io/), [Supabase](https://supabase.com/), [Neon](https://neon.com/)\\*, and [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/)\\*are seeing impressive growth, incumbents like [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/)\\*, Snowflake, MongoDB, andDatadog have enjoyed just as meaningful re-acceleration—as even new AI-native app builders are still primarily choosing existing platforms to manage their data, orchestrate workflows, and monitor operations.\n\n[![Startups are winning across application AI but trail incumbents in AI infrastructure](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/6-startups_winning_application_ai-scaled.webp)](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/6-startups_winning_application_ai-scaled.webp) Startups dominate AI applications, earning nearly $2 for every $1 incumbents earn, while enterprise infrastructure spend continues to favor incumbents.\n\n### **AI Applications: A $19 Billion Market**\n\nThe application layer captured **$19 billion** in 2025, more than half of all generative AI spending. This spend segments into three categories:\n\n- **Departmental AI**( **$7.3 billion**), built for specific job roles like software development or sales;\n- **Vertical AI**( **$3.5 billion**), targeting specific industries like healthcare or finance; and\n- **Horizontal AI**( **$8.4 billion**), increasing productivity across all functions.\n\n### **Departmental AI: Coding Is Generative AI’s First “Killer Use Case”**\n\nDepartmental AI spending hit **$7.3 billion** in 2025, up **4.1x** year over year. Coding is the clear standout at **$4.0 billion**( **55%** of departmental AI spend), making it the largest category across the entire application layer; the rest spans **IT**( **10%**), **marketing**( **9%**), **customer success**( **9%**), **design**( **7%**), and **HR**( **5%**).\n\n[![Departmental AI spend by category](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/7-departmental_ai_spend_by_category-scaled.webp)](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/7-departmental_ai_spend_by_category-scaled.webp) Coding has become the breakout use case in departmental AI.  Investment is concentrated where the impact is most immediate: product and engineering teams now account for the vast majority of spend.\n\nCode became AI’s first true “killer use case” as models reached economically meaningful performance—with Anthropic’s Sonnet 3.5 triggering the category’s initial breakout in [mid-2024](https://menlovc.com/2024-the-state-of-generative-ai-in-the-enterprise/). Adoption followed soon after; **50%** of developers now use AI coding tools daily ( **65%** in top-quartile orgs). Code completion grew to **$2.3 billion**, while code agents and AI app builders exploded from near-zero. Teams report **15%+** velocity gains as they’ve adopted AI tools across the software development lifecycle: from prototyping (Lovable) to code refactoring ( [Open Hands](https://openhands.dev/)\\*), design-to-code ( [Weaver](https://weaver.design/)), QA ( [Meticulous](https://www.meticulous.ai/)\\*), PRs ( [Graphite](https://graphite.dev/)\\*), site reliability engineering ( [Resolve](https://resolve.ai/)), and deployment ( [Harness](https://harness.io/)\\*).\n\n[![AI coding spend: 2024 vs. 2025](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/8-ai_coding_spend-scaled.webp)](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/8-ai_coding_spend-scaled.webp) The sharp jump from $550M to $4B in 2025 reflects a shift in capability: Models can now interpret entire codebases and execute multi-step tasks. Coding moves from a point solution to an end-to-end automation category.\n\nAlthough coding captures more than half of departmental AI spend at **$4 billion**, the technology is gaining traction across many enterprise departments. IT operations tools reached **$700 million** as teams automated incident response and infrastructure management. Marketing platforms hit **$660 million**, driven by content generation and campaign optimization. Customer success tools captured **$630 million**, with AI handling ticket routing, sentiment analysis, and proactive outreach. Each of these categories targets repetitive workflows where productivity gains are immediate and measurable. The market map below shows which players have emerged across functions to capture part of the **$7.3 billion** enterprise investment in departmental AI.\n\n[![Menlo Ventures’ departmental AI market map](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/9-departmental_ai_market_map-123125.webp)](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/9-departmental_ai_market_map-123125.webp) AI-native startups are rapidly emerging across every job function, capturing a meaningful share of the $7.3B spent on departmental AI in 2025.\n\n### **Vertical AI: Healthcare Leads Adoption**\n\nVertical AI solutions captured **$3.5 billion** in 2025, nearly **3x** the **$1.2 billion** invested in 2024. When segmented by industry, healthcare alone captures nearly half of all vertical AI spend—approximately **$1.5 billion**, more than tripling from **$450 million** the year prior and exceeding the next four verticals combined.\n\n[![Vertical AI spend by category](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/10-vertical_ai_spend_by_category-scaled.webp)](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/10-vertical_ai_spend_by_category-scaled.webp) $3.5B was invested across vertical sectors this year, nearly 3x last year’s spend. Healthcare represents $1.5B of that total, capturing 43% of the market and outspending the next four verticals combined.\n\nHealthcare moves slowly, bogged down by long procurement cycles and regulatory headwinds. But after years of rising administrative burden, shrinking margins, and chronic staffing shortages, health systems became one of the strongest sources of demand for AI automation anywhere in the economy.\n\nThe bulk of spend concentrates in administrative and clinical-adjacent workflows, led by ambient scribes. The scribe market reached **$600 million** in 2025 ( **+2.4x** YoY),[8](https://menlovc.com/perspective/2025-the-state-of-generative-ai-in-the-enterprise/#da2f0ee2-0187-454f-9418-9b24218f3f5a) minting two new unicorns ( [Abridge](https://www.abridge.com/) and [Ambience](https://www.ambiencehealthcare.com/)) alongside the market leader, Nuance’s DAX Copilot. Because clinicians spend roughly one hour documenting for every five hours of care, scribes that reduce documentation time by more than **50%** can dramatically reduce administrative burden and free doctors to practice at the top of their license.\n\n_For deeper analysis of how AI is transforming healthcare, see our_ [_2025: The State of AI in Healthcare_](https://menlovc.com/perspective/2025-the-state-of-ai-in-healthcare/) _report on adoption trends, budget shifts, and the areas where health systems are already seeing meaningful ROI._\n\nBeyond healthcare, AI is beginning to take hold across nearly every sector of the economy. Led by companies like [Eve](https://www.eve.legal/)\\*, legal has grown into a **$650 million** market; creator tools into **$360 million**; and government into **$350 million**. Adoption is strongest in industries historically underserved by software: fields defined by manual, unstructured workflows that once depended on human services but can now be automated with generative AI. The market map below highlights the companies building across these sectors and vying for a share of the **$3.5 billion** enterprises poured into vertical AI this year.\n\n[![Menlo Ventures’ vertical AI market map](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/11-vertical_ai_market_map-121925.webp)](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/11-vertical_ai_market_map-121925.webp) Vertical AI has become a $3.5B category in 2025, triple the dollars invested last year. These companies illustrate how AI-native software is emerging to serve every sector of the economy.\n\n### **Horizontal AI: Copilots Dwarf Agent Spend**\n\nAt **$8.4 billion**, horizontal AI remains the largest and fastest-growing category in the application layer, expanding **5.3x** year over year. Copilots dominate with **86%** share ( **$7.2 billion**)—led by [ChatGPT Enterprise](https://chatgpt.com/business/enterprise), [Claude for Work](https://www.claude.com/pricing/enterprise), and [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/). Agent platforms such as [Salesforce Agentforce](https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/), [Writer](https://writer.com/), and [Glean](https://www.glean.com/) capture another **10%**( **$750 million**), while personal productivity tools like [Granola](https://www.granola.ai/) and [Fyxer](https://www.fyxer.com/) account for the remaining **5%** ( **$450 million**).\n\n[![Horizontal AI spend by category](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/12-horizontal_ai_spend_by_category-scaled.webp)](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/12-horizontal_ai_spend_by_category-scaled.webp) General-purpose copilots dominate today, but as agents become more powerful, we can expect a shift from assistance to automation.\n\n### **AI Infrastructure: $18 Billion for “Picks and Shovels”**\n\nOur data shows the infrastructure layer captured **$18 billion** in 2025—the other half of all generative AI spending and up **2.0x** from **$9.2 billion** in 2024. This spend segments into three categories:\n\n- **Foundation model APIs**( **$12.5 billion**) power the intelligence behind all AI applications.\n- **Model training infrastructure**( **$4.0 billion**) enables frontier labs and enterprises to train and adapt models.\n- **AI infrastructure**( **$1.5 billion**) manages the storage, retrieval, and orchestration of data that connects LLMs to enterprise systems.\n\n### **LLM Market Share: Anthropic Extends Its Lead in the Enterprise**\n\nThe foundation model landscape shifted decisively this year when Anthropic surprised industry watchers by unseating OpenAIas the enterprise leader. We estimate Anthropicnow earns **40%** of enterprise LLM spend,[9](https://menlovc.com/perspective/2025-the-state-of-generative-ai-in-the-enterprise/#1ba2466c-0fa3-437f-83f7-4ebb67ba25c8) up from **24%** last year and **12%** in 2023. Over the same period, OpenAIlost nearly half of its enterprise share, falling to **27%** from **50%** in 2023. Googlealso saw significant gains, increasing its enterprise share from **7%** in 2023 to **21%** in 2025. Together, these three companies account for **88%** of enterprise LLM API usage, with the remaining **12%** spread across Meta’s [Llama](https://www.llama.com/), [Cohere](https://cohere.com/), [Mistral](https://mistral.ai/), and a long tail of smaller providers.\n\n[![Enterprise LLM API market share by usage](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/13-enterprise_llm_api_market_share-scaled.webp)](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/13-enterprise_llm_api_market_share-scaled.webp) Together, these views capture how the LLM ecosystem has shifted. The stacked bars show the magnitude of shifts in market share, the trend lines highlight the momentum behind the leading providers, and the coding share underscores where competitive advantage is being won.\n\nAnthropic’s ascent has been driven by its remarkably durable dominance in the coding market, where it now commands an estimated **54%** market share, compared to **21%** for OpenAI. This is up from **42%** just [six months ago](https://menlovc.com/perspective/2025-mid-year-llm-market-update/), driven in large part by the popularity of [Claude Code](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code).\n\nIn fact, Anthropic has now had an almost unparalleled **18 months** atop the LLM leaderboards for coding, starting with the release of Claude Sonnet 3.5 in June 2024. When Google released Gemini 3 Pro in mid-November 2025, its own model card[10](https://menlovc.com/perspective/2025-the-state-of-generative-ai-in-the-enterprise/#0ee51597-9523-4d10-bd33-a36dbe98268b) showed it leading most major evaluations—except SWE-bench Verified,[11](https://menlovc.com/perspective/2025-the-state-of-generative-ai-in-the-enterprise/#083da50d-69d4-4aa5-8f65-1d34bfcd40d7) where it still trailed Claude Sonnet 4.5. Just a week later, Anthropic widened the gap again with Claude Opus 4.5,[12](https://menlovc.com/perspective/2025-the-state-of-generative-ai-in-the-enterprise/#901c20cf-932e-4fe0-baab-457f8764a024) which reset the high-water mark for code generation and reaffirmed Anthropic’s position as the category’s top performer.\n\n### **Open-Source Models: Enterprise Adoption Lags the Broader Ecosystem**\n\nDespite falling off the frontier pace this year, Llama remains the most widely adopted open-weight model in the enterprise. But the model’s stagnation—including no new major releases since the April release of Llama 4—has contributed to a decline in overall enterprise open-source share from **19%** last year to **11%** today.\n\n[![Change in enterprise market share among open-source LLMs](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/14-open-source_llm_market_share-scaled.webp)](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/14-open-source_llm_market_share-scaled.webp) Enterprises remain cautious, preferring closed-source models. Open-source LLMs hold only 11% of today’s market, but developers are pushing boundaries, running Chinese models in production and testing new architectures at scale.\n\nEnterprises remain particularly cautious toward Chinese open-source models, despite their impressive progress this year and growing popularity among startups. Collectively, they account for just **1%** of total LLM API usage(roughly **10%** of enterprise open-source).\n\nOutside the enterprise, adoption looks very different. [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/) and [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/)\\*,[13](https://menlovc.com/perspective/2025-the-state-of-generative-ai-in-the-enterprise/#01deb3c2-477f-44dc-8f94-4531585ac936) two popular benchmarks for startup and indie developer usage, show rapidly rising adoption for [Qwen](https://qwen.ai/), [DeepSeek](https://www.deepseek.com/)(V3, R1), [Moonshot/Kimi](https://www.moonshot.ai/), [MiniMax](https://www.minimax.io/), and [Z AI’s GLM](https://chat.z.ai/), though DeepSeek’s usage has moderated after an initial surge following its R1 launch.\n\nSmaller models Qwen3 and GLM are especially popular for their competitive performance against much larger alternatives. Airbnb, for instance, relies on Qwen heavily for its user-facing AI features,[14](https://menlovc.com/perspective/2025-the-state-of-generative-ai-in-the-enterprise/#cdfe3f03-1fd9-4fcd-aa60-c9c0f28b203d) while Cursor uses the model as the open-source base for its internal model.[15](https://menlovc.com/perspective/2025-the-state-of-generative-ai-in-the-enterprise/#c82b47d9-cffd-4e02-bd4c-8038c7082a83)\n\n[![Monthly change in share of open-source LLM tokens processed, showing rising adoption of Chinese models in the broader developer ecosystem](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/15-chinese_model_adoption-scaled.webp)](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/15-chinese_model_adoption-scaled.webp) The distribution of open-source LLM tokens continues to evolve, with Chinese models gaining visible traction among developers over the past year.\n\n### **AI Infrastructure: A Modern AI Stack Still in Development**\n\nFor all the talk of “agents,” real production architectures remain surprisingly simple: Only **16%** of enterprise and **27%** of startup deployments qualify as true agents—systems where an LLM plans and executes actions, observes feedback, and adapts its behavior—while most are still built around fixed-sequence or routing-based workflows wrapped around a single model call.Customization patterns reinforce this technical nascency. **Prompt design** remains the dominant technique, followed by **retrieval-augmented generation**(RAG). More advanced approaches— **fine-tuning**, **tool calling**, **context engineering**, and **reinforcement learning** (RL)—are still niche and used primarily by frontier teams.\n\n[![AI architectures in production](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/16-ai_architectures_in_production-scaled.webp)](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/16-ai_architectures_in_production-scaled.webp) Strip away the hype and most “AI agents” are basic if-then logic around a model call. Simple architecture works for today’s use cases but reveals how early we are.\n\nBecause LLM-based application architectures continue to evolve gradually, the modern AI stack looks broadly similar to last year’s. The biggest beneficiaries so far are incumbents extending trusted data and infrastructure platforms: Databricks, Snowflake, MongoDB, and Datadog.\n\nStartup activity, on the other hand, clusters around inference and compute, where AI-native vendors compete directly with hyperscaler developer platforms. Inference platforms like [Fireworks](https://fireworks.ai/), [Baseten](https://www.baseten.co/), [Modal](https://modal.com/), and [Together](https://www.together.ai/) win on performance and developer experience—offering serverless, high-throughput, open-weight endpoints with **2x+** speedups through handwritten or fused kernels, optimized serving stacks, and tightly managed GPU fleets.\n\nFurther up the stack, a new wave of observability and tooling vendors, including [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), [Braintrust](https://www.braintrust.dev/), and [Judgment Labs](https://judgmentlabs.ai/), are building the runtime observability layer for AI, wedging in via developmental workflows including evals, tracing, and continuous learning. The market map below shows the key players building the foundational layers that power generative AI applications.\n\n[![The modern AI stack: the building blocks for generative AI](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/17-modern_ai_stack-121025-scaled.webp)](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/17-modern_ai_stack-121025-scaled.webp) Enterprises invested $18B in AI infrastructure across foundation models, training systems, and the data and orchestration layers. This market map shows the companies serving each part of that stack.\n\n### **What’s Next? Predictions for 2026**\n\nIn 2025, AI became the fastest-scaling software category in history. Based on what we’re seeing across the ecosystem, we have five predictions for the year ahead.\n\n\n[185 more lines in file. Use offset=201 to continue]"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1769795377336}}

Some numbers that made me pause:\n\n→ Enterprises spent $37B on generative AI in 2025 (up 3.2x from $11.5B in 2024)\n→ AI is now 6% of the entire global SaaS market... after just 3 years\n→ 76% of AI solutions are purchased, not built internally (was 53% last year)\n\nWhat's striking: AI buyers convert at 47% vs 25% for traditional SaaS. Nearly 2x higher.\n\nWhy? Because the value is immediate and obvious. Not speculative. Not \"maybe in 18 months.\" Right now productivity gains.\n\nThe biggest surprise: Startups now capture 63% of the AI application market. Incumbents had every advantage—distribution, data moats, balance sheets—and they're still losing ground.\n\nIn coding alone (a $4B category now), startups like Cursor are eating GitHub Copilot's lunch by shipping faster, being model-agnostic, and winning developer love first.\n\nMy take: We're past the experimentation phase. Enterprises aren't asking \"should we use AI?\" anymore. They're asking \"which AI tools should we buy?\"\n\nIf you're building AI-native products, the window is wide open.

Nearly 2x higher conversion. Why? Value is immediate. Not speculative. Not 'maybe next quarter.' Right now productivity gains. 3/ Another surprise: 76% of AI solutions are PURCHASED not built internally. Last year it was 53%. Enterprises tried building.

Source: Menlo Ventures 2025 Enterprise AI Report\",\n  \"reddit\": \"[Discussion] Just read Menlo Ventures' 2025 State of Generative AI in the Enterprise report—here are the numbers that surprised me most **The Scale:** • $37 billion spent on generative AI in 2025 (up 3.2x from $11.5B in 2024) • AI now represents 6% of the entire global SaaS market • All this growth happened within 3 years of ChatGPT's launch **The Adoption Pattern Shift:** 76% of AI solutions are now purchased rather than built internally (was only 53% in 2024). Enterprises tried the DIY route and realized ready-made solutions reach production faster with less headache. **The Conversion Surprise:** AI buyers convert at 47% vs 25% for traditional SaaS deals. Nearly double the conversion rate. The value proposition is immediate and obvious—not speculative roadmaps. **The Startup vs Incumbent Battle:** Startups now capture 63% of AI application revenue (up from 36% last year). Despite incumbents having every structural advantage—distribution, data moats, massive balance sheets—AI-native startups are winning on product velocity. **The Killer Use Case:** Coding is the breakout category: $4B in spend (55% of all departmental AI). 50% of developers now use AI coding tools daily. Companies like Cursor are beating GitHub Copilot by being model-agnostic and shipping faster. **The LLM Market Shake-up:** Anthropic now leads enterprise LLM market with 40% share. OpenAI fell to 27% (from 50% in 2023). 18 months of coding dominance with Claude Sonnet built durable enterprise trust. **Questions for the community:** - Are you seeing this shift toward buying vs building at your company? - Which AI tools have you actually adopted vs just piloted? - Do you think startup momentum in AI apps is sustainable, or will incumbents catch up? - What's your prediction for LLM market share by end of 2025?

Just read Menlo Ventures' 2025 State of Generative AI in the Enterprise report. Some numbers that made me pause:\n\n→ Enterprises spent $37B on generative AI in 2025 (up 3.2x from $11.5B in 2024)\n→ AI is now 6% of the entire global SaaS market... after just 3 years\n→ 76% of AI solutions are purchased, not built internally (was 53% last year)\n\nWhat's striking: AI buyers convert at 47% vs 25% for traditional SaaS. Nearly 2x higher. Why? Because the value is immediate and obvious. Not speculative. Not \"maybe in 18 months.\" Right now productivity gains.\n\nThe biggest surprise: Startups now capture 63% of the AI application market. Incumbents had every advantage—distribution, data moats, balance sheets—and they're still losing ground.\n\nMy take: We're past the experimentation phase. Enterprises aren't asking \"should we use AI?\" anymore. They're asking \"which AI tools should we buy?\"\n\n*#AI #SaaS #EnterpriseAI #StartupLife #BuildingInPublic #VentureCapital*\n\n---\n\n### 🐦 **X THREAD**\n\n🧵 The $37B AI wave is here—and the data reveals where the market is actually heading:\n\n1/ Just read Menlo Ventures' 2025 Enterprise AI Report.\n\nKey numbers that stopped me cold:\n• $37B spent on generative AI in 2025 (3.2x growth from 2024)\n• AI now = 6% of entire global SaaS market\n• All this happened in just 3 years post-ChatGPT\n\n2/ The most striking stat:\n\nAI buyers convert at 47% vs 25% for traditional SaaS.\n\nNearly 2x higher conversion. Why? Value is immediate. Not speculative.\n\n3/ Another surprise: 76% of AI solutions are PURCHASED not built internally.\n\nLast year it was 53%. Enterprises tried building. Realized ready-made solutions get to production faster.\n\n4/ Startups now capture 63% of AI application market.\n\nUp from 36% last year. Incumbents had every structural advantage—and they're still bleeding market share.\n\n5/ Coding is the killer use case: $4B spend (55% of all departmental AI).\n\nCursor is eating GitHub Copilot's lunch. How? Model-agnostic + faster shipping + developer love first.\n\n6/ Anthropic now leads enterprise LLM market: 40% share.\n\nOpenAI at 27% (down from 50% in 2023).\n\n7/ Bottom line: Enterprises aren't asking \"should we use AI?\" anymore.\n\nThey're asking \"which AI tools should we buy?\"\n\nIf you're building AI-native products, the window is wide open. But velocity > everything.\n\n---\n\n### 👽 **REDDIT POST**\n\n**[Discussion] Just read Menlo Ventures' 2025 State of Generative AI in the Enterprise report—here are the numbers that surprised me most**\n\n**The Scale:**\n• $37 billion spent on generative AI in 2025 (up 3.2x from $11.5B in 2024)\n• AI now represents 6% of the entire global SaaS market\n• All this growth happened within 3 years of ChatGPT's launch\n\n**The Adoption Pattern Shift:**\n76% of AI solutions are now purchased rather than built internally (was only 53% in 2024). Enterprises tried the DIY route and realized ready-made solutions reach production faster with less headache.\n\n**The Conversion Surprise:**\nAI buyers convert at 47% vs 25% for traditional SaaS deals. Nearly double the conversion rate. The value proposition is immediate and obvious—not speculative roadmaps.\n\n**The Startup vs Incumbent Battle:**\nStartups now capture 63% of AI application revenue (up from 36% last year). Despite incumbents having every structural advantage, AI-native startups are winning on product velocity.\n\n**Questions for the community:**\n- Are you seeing this shift toward buying vs building at your company?\n- Which AI tools have you actually adopted vs just piloted?\n- Do you think startup momentum in AI apps is sustainable, or will incumbents catch up?\n\n---\n\n### 💾 **FILES SAVED**\n- `memory/content_rMrq1tRAD0A_20260130.json` (final combined)\n- `memory/linkedin_rMrq1tRAD0A_final.md`\n- `memory/x_thread_rMrq1tRAD0A_final.md`\n- `memory/reddit_rMrq1tRAD0A_final.md`\n- `memory/sheets_log.jsonl` (updated)\n\n---\n\n**Status:** ✅ Generated LinkedIn, X, Reddit | 💾 Logged to memory | 🎬 Source: Menlo Ventures 2025 Enterprise AI Report"}],"api":"openai-completions","provider":"kimi-code","model":"kimi-k2.5","usage":{"input":38783,"output":1293,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"totalTokens":40076,"cost":{"input":0,"output":0,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1769795449569}}
