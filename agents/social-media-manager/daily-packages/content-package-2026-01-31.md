## 📋 CURATED POSTS FOR TODAY

### 🟦 LINKEDIN POST (Recommended)

**Optimal Time:** Today 11:00 AM IST

```
### 🔥 HORMOZI FRAMEWORK
```
I finally understand neural networks. And I didn't write a single line of math.

3Blue1Brown just released the most elegant explanation of how AI actually works.

Here's what clicked for me:

→ Neural networks aren't "thinking" - they're pattern recognition machines
→ Each layer extracts features: edges → shapes → objects → concepts  
→ Training isn't programming - it's sculpting by subtraction
→ The "magic" is just calculus finding patterns we can't see

The video uses visual intuition instead of equations. And somehow that makes it MORE powerful, not less.

Because here's the thing: Understanding AI conceptually beats memorizing formulas.

When you grasp HOW it works:
- You spot opportunities others miss
- You ask better questions of the tools
- You know what's possible vs. hype

AI literacy isn't about coding.

It's about knowing what these systems can and cannot do.

### 🐦 X/TWITTER POST (Thread Format)

**Optimal Time:** Today 4:00 PM IST

```
### 🧠 NAVAL FRAMEWORK
```
"Learn the fundamentals. The rest is commentary."

3Blue1Brown's neural network video is a masterclass in this principle.

Everyone's chasing AI tutorials, prompts, and "hacks."

Few are taking 20 minutes to understand the foundation.

But the foundation is where leverage lives.

When you understand how neural networks actually work:
- You don't need to memorize prompt engineering tricks (you'll invent them)
- You don't chase every new AI tool (you know what's structural vs. cosmetic)
```
