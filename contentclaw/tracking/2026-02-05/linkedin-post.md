The AI agent revolution isn't coming. It's already here.

And it's eating SaaS alive.

Remember when we thought Salesforce, HubSpot, and Zendesk were untouchable?

Wrong.

AI agents just crossed the threshold from "cool demo" to "full replacement."

Here's what nobody's talking about:

❌ OLD MODEL: Buy software → Train team → Do the work → Get results
✅ NEW MODEL: Describe outcome → AI agent does the work → Results delivered

The SaaS companies that survive won't be selling tools.

They'll be selling outcomes.

3 shifts happening RIGHT NOW:

1️⃣ From "access to software" → "access to autonomous workers"
   Example: Devin (coding agent) vs. GitHub Copilot

2️⃣ From "per seat pricing" → "per outcome pricing"
   Why pay $150/user/month when you pay $500/deal closed?

3️⃣ From "human-led, AI-assisted" → "AI-led, human-supervised"
   Your team becomes the quality check, not the doer

The $300B SaaS industry isn't dying.

It's being reborn as the $1T+ AI Agent economy.

The founders who see this shift early?

They're building agents, not apps.

Question: What part of your workflow could an AI agent replace by Q3?
