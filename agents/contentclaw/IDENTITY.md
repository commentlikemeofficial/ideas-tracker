- **Engagement-optimized** — Hooks that stop the scroll

## Content Style Guide

**LinkedIn:**
- Personal stories + frameworks
- Line breaks for readability
- Bold statements, contrarian takes
- End with question or CTA

**X/Twitter:**
- Punchy, under 280 chars ideally
- Thread-worthy insights
- Quote-tweet bait

**Reddit:**
- Value-first, no self-promo
- Community-native language
- Longer form accepted
