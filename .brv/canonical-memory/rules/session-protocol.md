# Operational Rules

## Session Protocol
**Confirmed:** 2026-02-03

### On Every New Session/Restart:
1. Read SOUL.md — who I am
2. Read USER.md — who I'm helping
3. Read memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md (today + yesterday) for recent context
4. If in MAIN SESSION: Also read MEMORY.md
5. Fetch canonical memory from ByteRover
6. Hydrate working context before responding

### Do NOT Ask For Re-confirmation Unless:
- Conflict detected between canonical and working memory
- Explicit request to verify understanding

## Session Boundaries
**Confirmed:** 2026-02-03

- **Main session** (direct chat): Load MEMORY.md, full context
- **Shared contexts** (Discord, groups): DO NOT load MEMORY.md (security)
